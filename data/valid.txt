That you depart and lay no hands on me

Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,

If God will be revenged for this deed.

I am his brother, and I love him well.
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Right,
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
First Murderer:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

And when I have my meed, I must away;

Who told me, when we both lay in the field
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
Oh, poor Clarence!
BUCKINGHAM:
Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
I do lament the sickness of the king.
Girl:
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?


Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,

I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.


How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Here comes a messenger. What news?


Why or for what these nobles were committed

Self against self: O, preposterous

Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;


Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
HASTINGS:
If I may counsel you, some day or two
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
PRINCE EDWARD:

Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.

And therefore is he idle?
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.



GLOUCESTER:

So cunning and so young is wonderful.

PRINCE EDWARD:
GLOUCESTER:
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
To sit about the coronation.
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
My good lords both, with all the heed I may.


What, ho! my lord!
Messenger:
HASTINGS:
If presently you will take horse with him,
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.


Ay, my good lord.
And thereupon he sends you this good news,

CATESBY:

For they account his head upon the bridge.
I do not like these several councils, I.
STANLEY:
Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
Pursuivant:


HASTINGS:


Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,

Is, to determine of the coronation.
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
His gracious pleasure any way therein:
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
My lord?
GLOUCESTER:


What of his heart perceive you in his face
GLOUCESTER:
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
HASTINGS:

I now repent I told the pursuivant

Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
Are at my service, like enforced smiles;

BUCKINGHAM:
Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
Would you imagine, or almost believe,
What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
The traitor speak, and timorously confess
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
And, by just computation of the time,
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.

Scrivener:
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
And his enforcement of the city wives;
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
When he had done, some followers of mine own,
What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
In deep designs and matters of great moment,
But on his knees at meditation;
Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
So sweet is zealous contemplation.
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?

The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
Your very worshipful and loving friends,
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
First if all obstacles were cut away,
And much I need to help you, if need were;
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
A care-crazed mother of a many children,
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.

I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
CATESBY:
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
How far I am from the desire thereof.
Long live Richard, England's royal king!

Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
The king! why, who's that?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
QUEEN ELIZABETH:

O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
Of golden metal that must round my brow
No! why?  When he that is my husband now
As miserable by the life of thee
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
My gracious sovereign?
Still live they and for ever may they last!
KING RICHARD III:
True, noble prince.
BUCKINGHAM:
I will resolve your grace immediately.

Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
KING RICHARD III:
To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
Rumour it abroad
I must be married to my brother's daughter,

TYRREL:
TYRREL:
TYRREL:
My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.




KING RICHARD III:
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
The most arch of piteous massacre
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
For it is done, my lord.

Farewell till soon.
CATESBY:

We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
QUEEN MARGARET:
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.

As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
And now I cloy me with beholding it.
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.

And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
Or with the clamorous report of war
Then patiently hear my impatience.
Do then: but I'll not hear.
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
your grace
You speak too bitterly.
Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
And promise them success and victory.


Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
No, to the dignity and height of honour
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
KING RICHARD III:
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
To win our daughter.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
KING RICHARD III:
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.

KING RICHARD III:
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.


QUEEN ELIZABETH:
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
KING RICHARD III:
Thyself thyself misusest.
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,

Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
Be the attorney of my love to her:
Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.

And be a happy mother by the deed.

KING RICHARD III:
When thou comest thither--
The greatest strength and power he can make,
KING RICHARD III:
STANLEY:
STANLEY:
KING RICHARD III:
What heir of York is there alive but we?
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.

Please it your majesty to give me leave,
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
So deal with him as I prove true to you.
My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;

There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
KING RICHARD III:
If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
CHRISTOPHER:
Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:


By the false faith of him I trusted most;
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

Who hath descried the number of the foe?
Let us survey the vantage of the field
Give me some ink and paper in my tent
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
If without peril it be possible,
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
KING RICHARD III:
Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
I warrant you, my lord.
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power

So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent

I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
God give us leisure for these rites of love!
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
Ghost of Prince Edward:
Ghost of VAUGHAN:
Ghost of BUCKINGHAM:
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
RATCLIFF:
No doubt, my lord.
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
RICHMOND:
Have I since your departure had, my lords.
RICHMOND:
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
RATCLIFF:
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
And thus my battle shall be ordered:

KING RICHARD III:
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
DERBY:

England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
KING RICHARD II:

Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
Many years of happy days befal
As well appeareth by the cause you come;
Come I appellant to this princely presence.
With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
I take it up; and by that sword I swear
So much as of a thought of ill in him.
That ever was survey'd by English eye,
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
The honourable father to my foe
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
This we prescribe, though no physician;


Which breathed this poison.
Is spotless reputation: that away,
Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
Since we can not atone you, we shall see
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
That which in mean men we intitle patience
An angry arm against His minister.
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
With her companion grief must end her life.
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,

Marshal, demand of yonder champion
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
To prove him, in defending of myself,

To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
Appointed to direct these fair designs.
Lord Marshal:

Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
Even in the lusty havior of his son.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
Second Herald:
Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
The language I have learn'd these forty years,
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
THOMAS MOWBRAY:
You never shall, so help you truth and God!
I swear.
As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
Return with welcome home from banishment.
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;

KING RICHARD II:
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
But that I was a journeyman to grief?
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
O, no! the apprehension of the good
Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
And had the tribute of his supple knee,
For their advantage and your highness' loss.
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,

The lining of his coffers shall make coats
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
DUKE OF YORK:
That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Against infection and the hand of war,
For Christian service and true chivalry,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
QUEEN:
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
JOHN OF GAUNT:
I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
It were a shame to let this land by lease;
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
That blood already, like the pelican,
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
To wayward sickliness and age in him:

Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
KING RICHARD II:
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
Call in the letters patent that he hath
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,

His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!

Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
LORD WILLOUGHBY:
To please the king I did; to please myself
BUSHY:
Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
At Ravenspurgh.



Here comes the Duke of York.
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.

My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
DUKE OF YORK:
And bring away the armour that is there.
Dispose of you.
Proportionable to the enemy
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found

HENRY PERCY:

What power the Duke of York had levied there;

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:

Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
My lords of England, let me tell you this:
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
I would attach you all and make you stoop
To Bristol castle, which they say is held


These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
Near to the king in blood, and near in love
To show the world I am a gentleman.
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
DUKE OF YORK:
Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:

He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
But when from under this terrestrial ball
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
KING RICHARD II:


Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
To bear the tidings of calamity.
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made

And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
Comes at the last and with a little pin
BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
And all your northern castles yielded up,
That bids me be of comfort any more.

Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
When such a sacred king should hide his head.
For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
Why, it contains no king?
NORTHUMBERLAND:
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
Of his bright passage to the occident.
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,

Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
On yon proud man, should take it off again

My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
KING RICHARD II:
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
And show fair duty to his majesty.


Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
To drive away the heavy thought of care?
Madam, we'll dance.
QUEEN:
Or if of grief, being altogether had,
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
They are; and Bolingbroke
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
And some few vanities that make him light;
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
BAGOT:
Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.


LORD FITZWATER:
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
Of capital treason we arrest you here.
DUKE OF YORK:
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
God save the king! Will no man say amen?
To Henry Bolingbroke.
That bucket down and full of tears am I,


The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
KING RICHARD II:
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.

Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
And these external manners of laments
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Then give me leave to go.

A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
Abbot:

That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
QUEEN:

And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,

And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
KING RICHARD II:
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
So many greedy looks of young and old
DUCHESS OF YORK:
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
I am in parliament pledge for his truth

You will be there, I know.
My lord, 'tis nothing.

DUKE OF YORK:
Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
DUCHESS OF YORK:



And rob me of a happy mother's name?
DUCHESS OF YORK:
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
Make way, unruly woman!

And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
And what said the gallant?
I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
That no man enter till my tale be done.
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
DUKE OF YORK:
It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
From when this stream through muddy passages
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
DUCHESS OF YORK:




We pray with heart and soul and all beside:


Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

With all the rest of that consorted crew,
Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
EXTON:
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
'It is as hard to come as for a camel
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
Then am I king'd again: and by and by
To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
That brings me food to make misfortune live?
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
KING RICHARD II:
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.

How now! what means death in this rude assault?
As full of valour as of royal blood:
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;


Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
Nurse:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
And he shall signify from time to time
That we have had no time to move our daughter:

Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
She shall be married to this noble earl.
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
Madam!
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
Ere I again behold my Romeo!
ROMEO:
ROMEO:



Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
That same villain, Romeo.

Indeed, I never shall be satisfied

Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
But for the sunset of my brother's son
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
LADY CAPULET:
Or never after look me in the face:
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
O, God ye god-den.
LADY CAPULET:
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
Nurse:
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
And from my soul too;
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,

Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,

That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

PARIS:
JULIET:

My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
FRIAR LAURENCE:
So many guests invite as here are writ.
Second Servant:
Nurse:
CAPULET:

CAPULET:
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
'Tis now near night.
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
LADY CAPULET:

Nurse! What should she do here?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
Together with the terror of the place,--
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
What's there?
Second Servant:
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
What is the matter?
CAPULET:
Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
O woful time!
Ready to go, but never to return.
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
Nurse:
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
And with my child my joys are buried.
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
And all things change them to the contrary.
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's

PETER:
First Musician:

Then music with her silver sound'--
Second Musician:
O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.


No matter: get thee gone,
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
ROMEO:
Apothecary:
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Put this in any liquid thing you will,
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me


Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
PAGE:
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
The time and my intents are savage-wild,

This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
ROMEO:
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
What said my man, when my betossed soul
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!

BALTHASAR:
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I dare not, sir
As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
FRIAR LAURENCE:
I dare no longer stay.
Thy lips are warm.
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
Third Watchman:
That calls our person from our morning's rest?
PRINCE:

And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
MONTAGUE:
To press before thy father to a grave?
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
This letter doth make good the friar's words,

There shall no figure at such rate be set
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
He slily stole away and left his men:
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;


YORK:

RICHARD:
Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
KING HENRY VI:
If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.

To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
EXETER:
Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
KING HENRY VI:


Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,

What then?
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
KING HENRY VI:
My conscience tells me he is lawful king.

May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
WARWICK:
YORK:

WESTMORELAND:
Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,

WARWICK:
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
KING HENRY VI:
Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.


And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
PRINCE EDWARD:
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
QUEEN MARGARET:
When I return with victory from the field
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,

I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.

But that I seek occasion how to rise,

MONTAGUE:
YORK:

Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?

That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:

And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
RUTLAND:
He be as miserably slain as I.
Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!
The army of the queen hath got the field:
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
I will not bandy with thee word for word,
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
NORTHUMBERLAND:
QUEEN MARGARET:
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
I should lament thy miserable state.
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Now in his life, against your holy oath?

To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;

And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.


The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?


Your princely father and my loving lord!
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.

Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,

If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
EDWARD:


To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
And hearten those that fight in your defence:
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms

Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.

RICHARD:

Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;

As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,

Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
WARWICK:
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
Here on my knee I vow to God above,
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
And call them pillars that will stand to us;
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
To execute the like upon thyself;
When dying clouds contend with growing light,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
To be no better than a homely swain;
So many hours must I take my rest;
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
Son:
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
And so obsequious will thy father be,
PRINCE EDWARD:
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,


From off the gates of York fetch down the head,

Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

RICHARD:

The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
And never will I undertake the thing
WARWICK:
Culling the principal of all the deer.
I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,


For she's a woman to be pitied much:
He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
Second Keeper:

Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:

And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.

The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.

Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
That I must yield my body to the earth
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,

And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,

What though the mast be now blown overboard,
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.

Infuse his breast with magnanimity

If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Why, then thou art an executioner.
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
And not in me: I am myself alone.
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
