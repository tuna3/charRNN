And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;

Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

And yet his punishment was cruel death.
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
And I unjustly too, must grant it you

And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

Madam, and you, my mother, will you go

With all your just proceedings in this cause.

Moreover, urge his hateful luxury

This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
That seeth not this palpable device?
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,

But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,

And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,

No less importing than our general good,
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,

Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
And by their vehement instigation,
Which fondly you would here impose on me;

But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self

LORD STANLEY:
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!


Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,

Your grace may do your pleasure.

Page:
Gold were as good as twenty orators,
I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
Where he abides.
That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
KING RICHARD III:
Ay, my lord;
Let me have open means to come to them,
'Tis done, my gracious lord.
The late demand that you did sound me in.


BUCKINGHAM:
KING RICHARD III:
KING RICHARD III:
BUCKINGHAM:
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke

That ever yet this land was guilty of.
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
And here he comes.

TYRREL:
The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
My lord!
KING RICHARD III:


Hover about her; say, that right for right
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
DUCHESS OF YORK:
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Windy attorneys to their client woes,
I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
QUEEN ELIZABETH:

Thus will I drown your exclamations.



Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
To breakfast once forth of my company.

Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
QUEEN ELIZABETH:

KING RICHARD III:
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
To be discover'd, that can do me good?
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul

And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
KING RICHARD III:
How canst thou woo her?
Madam, with all my heart.
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.

Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
To quicken your increase, I will beget
The loss you have is but a son being king,
Again shall you be mother to a king,
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale

Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

QUEEN ELIZABETH:
KING RICHARD III:
Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
My father's death--

The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
QUEEN ELIZABETH:
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;

KING RICHARD III:

RATCLIFF:
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
Dull, unmindful villain,
And meet me presently at Salisbury.
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
Richmond is on the seas.
Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
And who is England's king but great York's heir?

STANLEY:
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
I never was nor never will be false.

And every hour more competitors
Third Messenger:
Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
If not to fight with foreign enemies,
Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
The fear of that withholds my present aid.
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
BUCKINGHAM:
Sheriff:
This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,

Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.

KING RICHARD III:

Call for some men of sound direction
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.
I will not sup to-night.
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
KING RICHARD III:
I have not that alacrity of spirit,
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
DERBY:
With best advantage will deceive the time,
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,



Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Came to my tent; and every one did threat
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock

Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
That he was never trained up in arms.
Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.

That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
NORFOLK:
Off with his son George's head!
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!

I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
RICHMOND:
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
KING RICHARD II:

My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,

That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
O, let my sovereign turn away his face
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
Deep malice makes too deep incision;
KING RICHARD II:
THOMAS MOWBRAY:

Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.

Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
Justice design the victor's chivalry.
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.

Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:

Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
Lord Marshal:
The cause of his arrival here in arms:

A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
Lord Marshal:
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,

The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:

Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
This feast of battle with mine adversary.


Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
The hopeless word of 'never to return'
My native English, now I must forego:
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
Embrace each other's love in banishment;

Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;

For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
JOHN OF GAUNT:
Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
A partial slander sought I to avoid,

O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,

JOHN OF GAUNT:
The precious jewel of thy home return.

And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
But to the next highway, and there I left him.

Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
Observed his courtship to the common people;
With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'

They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
KING RICHARD II:
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.

He that no more must say is listen'd more
No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
This happy breed of men, this little world,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;

No, no, men living flatter those that die.

Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
But for thy world enjoying but this land,
With fury from his native residence.
Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
KING RICHARD II:
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
But when he frown'd, it was against the French
Why, uncle, what's the matter?
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
By his attorneys-general to sue

To see this business. To-morrow next

LORD ROSS:
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
In him, a royal prince, and many moe
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
But basely yielded upon compromise
NORTHUMBERLAND:
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:

BUSHY:
QUEEN:
QUEEN:

Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
DUKE OF YORK:
To-day, as I came by, I called there;
God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
Is all unpossible.

The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.

In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
NORTHUMBERLAND:
I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure


LORD WILLOUGHBY:

LORD BERKELEY:
I shall not need transport my words by you;
DUKE OF YORK:
And ostentation of despised arms?
And minister correction to thy fault!
Before the expiration of thy time,
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
I am denied to sue my livery here,
The noble duke hath been too much abused.
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
But for his own; and for the right of that
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
Captain:
Captain:
Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
You have misled a prince, a royal king,
Till you did make him misinterpret me,
This and much more, much more than twice all this,
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd

As a long-parted mother with her child
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
BISHOP OF CARLISLE:
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
Not able to endure the sight of day,
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
But now the blood of twenty thousand men
KING RICHARD II:
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP:
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
Like an unseasonable stormy day,
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
DUKE OF AUMERLE:
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
My father hath a power; inquire of him

And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
KING RICHARD II:
With some few private friends upon this coast.


Against their will. But who comes here?

O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
To his most royal person, hither come
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:

Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
And we are barren and bereft of friends;
The purple testament of bleeding war;
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
His coming hither hath no further scope
KING RICHARD II:
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
With words of sooth! O that I were as great
KING RICHARD II:
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
What says his majesty?
My gracious lord,--
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
KING RICHARD II:



Of sorrow or of joy?
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:

They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
That tell black tidings.
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
To serve me last, that I may longest keep
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
Adding withal how blest this land would be
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
Excepting one, I would he were the best
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
An if I do not, may my hands rot off

LORD FITZWATER:
DUKE OF SURREY:
How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
To execute the noble duke at Calais.
And, though mine enemy, restored again
And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
As surely as I live, my lord.
From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
Marry. God forbid!
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
I will be his conduct.
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.

Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
Committed by your person and your followers
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
And water cannot wash away your sin.
I find myself a traitor with the rest;
No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
An if my word be sterling yet in England,

KING RICHARD II:
That every day under his household roof

Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
Name it, fair cousin.
Yet ask.

KING RICHARD II:

My lord,
QUEEN:
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
To think our former state a happy dream;
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
KING RICHARD II:
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
NORTHUMBERLAND:
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.

KING RICHARD II:
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
When weeping made you break the story off,

Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
DUKE OF YORK:


DUKE OF YORK:
Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond

Why, what is it, my lord?
DUKE OF YORK:
DUCHESS OF YORK:
DUKE OF YORK:
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
He shall be none;
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,

May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
Hath held his current and defiled himself!
Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
DUKE OF YORK:
DUKE OF YORK:
DUCHESS OF YORK:
DUKE OF YORK:
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
DUCHESS OF YORK:
DUKE OF YORK:
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;

HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.

'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
My soul the father; and these two beget
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
That many have and others must sit there;
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
But for the concord of my state and time
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans


That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.


Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:
HENRY BOLINGBROKE:

Great king, within this coffin I present
EXTON:
And never show thy head by day nor light.

GREGORY:
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY:
GREGORY:

'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY:
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
ABRAHAM:


SAMPSON:
You lie.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Have at thee, coward!
A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
For this time, all the rest depart away:

Came more and more and fought on part and part,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;

Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out

As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
MONTAGUE:
BENVOLIO:
ROMEO:
Of love?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
sick health!

Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;


BENVOLIO:
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
BENVOLIO:
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
Examine other beauties.
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Go, sirrah, trudge about
sent to find those persons whose names are here
And the rank poison of the old will die.

God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
Whither?

BENVOLIO:
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
Your lady's love against some other maid

Your mother.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
It is an honour that I dream not of.
I was your mother much upon these years

And see how one another lends content
By having him, making yourself no less.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
We follow thee.
BENVOLIO:
ROMEO:
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTIO:
But every man betake him to his legs.
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.

MERCUTIO:
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,

And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Strike, drum.
First Servant:
First Servant:
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,


ROMEO:
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
CAPULET:

Here in my house do him disparagement:
CAPULET:

TYBALT:
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
ROMEO:


And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
JULIET:
I know not.
JULIET:
A rhyme I learn'd even now
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
MERCUTIO:
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
ROMEO:
By a name

ROMEO:
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
My life were better ended by their hate,
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.

Do not swear at all;
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
And yet I would it were to give again.
The more I have, for both are infinite.
JULIET:

To-morrow will I send.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
With repetition of my Romeo's name.
ROMEO:
JULIET:

And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
sweet sorrow,
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
And from her womb children of divers kind
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;

And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;


FRIAR LAURENCE:
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,

This but begins the woe, others must end.
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
This shall determine that.


The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:

Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,

Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
Immediately we do exile him hence:
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
Ay, ay, the cords.
JULIET:
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?

Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
There's no trust,
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'

He made you for a highway to my bed;

ROMEO:
ROMEO:
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
And world's exile is death: then banished,
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
ROMEO:
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
FRIAR LAURENCE:
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;

Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Nurse:

Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night

Every good hap to you that chances here:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
LADY CAPULET:
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?

JULIET:
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
O, now I would they had changed voices too!



I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
LADY CAPULET:

LADY CAPULET:
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
LADY CAPULET:
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
It rains downright.
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;


You are too hot.
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
Faith, here it is.
I think you are happy in this second match,
Or else beshrew them both.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
PARIS:
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
FRIAR LAURENCE:

JULIET:
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
The tears have got small victory by that;
PARIS:
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
Ay, forsooth.
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
CAPULET:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:


Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
LADY CAPULET:
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,

Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;

O son! the night before thy wedding-day

O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!

And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

I will then give it you soundly.
Then I will give you the serving-creature.

to think!--

ROMEO:
ROMEO:
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
FRIAR JOHN:
FRIAR LAURENCE:
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Now must I to the monument alone;
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.

To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
Why I descend into this bed of death,
More fierce and more inexorable far
BALTHASAR:
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.


Did not attend him as we rode? I think
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
And never from this palace of dim night
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
BALTHASAR:
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
How long hath he been there?
My master knows not but I am gone hence;
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest



But the true ground of all these piteous woes
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:

What fear is this which startles in our ears?
First Watchman:

Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;



You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
And then in post he came from Mantua

Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
CAPULET:
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
YORK:
WARWICK:
Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
WARWICK:
Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
I mean to take possession of my right.
My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,


KING HENRY VI:
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
In following this usurping Henry.




Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
The lord protector lost it, and not I:
MONTAGUE:
KING HENRY VI:
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
KING HENRY VI:


Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

NORTHUMBERLAND:
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
WARWICK:
I cannot stay to hear these articles.
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
WARWICK:
Why should you sigh, my lord?
And neither by treason nor hostility
And long live thou and these thy forward sons!

KING HENRY VI:
QUEEN MARGARET:
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Father, you cannot disinherit me:
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
RICHARD:
Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
About that which concerns your grace and us;
Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:

YORK:
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
And yet the king not privy to my drift,
YORK:
Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
What, with five thousand men?
YORK:
Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
CLIFFORD:

Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
CLIFFORD:
Therefore--
I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
Ah, let me live in prison all my days;

My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
A bird that will revenge upon you all:

But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
So doth the cony struggle in the net.
Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
YORK:
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Frenchwoman.
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
QUEEN MARGARET:

EDWARD:
RICHARD:
So fared our father with his enemies;

EDWARD:
RICHARD:

Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
RICHARD:
Or die renowned by attempting it.
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
For by my scouts I was advertised
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
And we in them no hope to win the day;

But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
RICHARD:

And now to London all the crew are gone,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
WARWICK:
KING HENRY VI:
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
And would my father had left me no more!
You promised knighthood to our forward son:
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
And in the towns, as they do march along,

Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
CLIFFORD:

WARWICK:

RICHARD:
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
KING HENRY VI:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
For York in justice puts his armour on.
QUEEN MARGARET:
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
QUEEN MARGARET:
I lay me down a little while to breathe;
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
I'll never pause again, never stand still,
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
And so, have at thee!
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
So is the equal of this fell war.
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
So many hours must I contemplate;
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
His body couched in a curious bed,
Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;

Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
How will my mother for a father's death


Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
EDWARD:
RICHARD:
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
WARWICK:
Which in the time of death he gave our father.

EDWARD:
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
WARWICK:
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
Tut, that's a foolish observation:

In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
KING HENRY VI:
KING HENRY VI:
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
KING HENRY VI:
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
KING HENRY VI:
Here in this country, where we now remain.
For we were subjects but while you were king.
Such is the lightness of you common men.
So would you be again to Henry,
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
KING EDWARD IV:
GLOUCESTER:

And would you not do much to do them good?

LADY GREY:
Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?

The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
KING EDWARD IV:
My mind will never grant what I perceive
Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
No more than when my daughters call thee mother.

CLARENCE:
That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
Our people and our peers are both misled,



To England's king in lawful marriage.
But from deceit bred by necessity;


WARWICK:
Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Call him my king by whose injurious doom

Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
WARWICK:
As may beseem a monarch like himself.

Touching the jointure that your king must make,
By this alliance to make void my suit:
That your estate requires and mine can yield.
Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
Post:
KING LEWIS XI:
What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
WARWICK:
Did I put Henry from his native right?
QUEEN MARGARET:
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.


Then, England's messenger, return in post,
QUEEN MARGARET:
But, Warwick,
That if our queen and this young prince agree,

For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
CLARENCE:
CLARENCE:
That they'll take no offence at our abuse.

KING EDWARD IV:
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
MONTAGUE:
But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
Unto the brother of your loving bride;
Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
At my depart, these were his very words:
These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
They are already, or quickly will be landed:
That I may never have you in suspect.

WARWICK:
Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
And but attended by a simple guard,
You that will follow me to this attempt,
Second Watchman:
If Warwick be so near as men report.
O, is it so? But why commands the king
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
WARWICK:


Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
I'll follow you, and tell what answer
But march to London with our soldiers?


Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:

Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
He hath good usage and great liberty,
This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.


Huntsman:

But if an humble prayer may prevail,
They quite forget their loss of liberty.
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
CLARENCE:
KING HENRY VI:
What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
I mean, in bearing weight of government,
Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
CLARENCE:
KING HENRY VI:
Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
My brother was too careless of his charge.
So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
SOMERSET:
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas

My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,


I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
GLOUCESTER:


Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.

Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
KING EDWARD IV:
Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
And many giddy people flock to him.
In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
CLARENCE:
And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.
Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
And take the great-grown traitor unawares:

And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
KING EDWARD IV:
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair



Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
CLARENCE:
To keep that oath were more impiety
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:

I will away towards Barnet presently,
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.

Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!

Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
And Montague our topmost; what of him?
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
If case some one of you would fly from us,
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
Women and children of so high a courage,



Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.


What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.


GLOUCESTER:
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
GLOUCESTER:
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
CLARENCE:
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:

Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:

Or is the adder better than the eel,
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
I warrant you.
Tut, fear not me.
Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
And therefore, if you say no more than this,

We'll pass the business privately and well.
Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.




I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint

KATHARINA:
HORTENSIO:
I say it is the moon.
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
And not unluckily against the bias.


Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,

The spouse of any noble gentleman.
HORTENSIO:
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.
Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and

What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
make merry withal?

Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal

Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

TRANIO:

Swear, if thou darest.

BIANCA:
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

KATHARINA:
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

PETRUCHIO:
KATHARINA:
My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
KATHARINA:
A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.


And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
Which runs himself and catches for his master.
O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
And he whose wife is most obedient
PETRUCHIO:



Ay, and a kind one too:
PETRUCHIO:
She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
I know her answer.

KATHARINA:

Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
PETRUCHIO:
Widow:
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
To painful labour both by sea and land,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

HORTENSIO:
Here, master: what cheer?
if room enough!
Where is the master, boatswain?
When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers

Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!

For our case is as theirs.
GONZALO:

The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
The fraughting souls within her.
PROSPERO:
More to know
I have with such provision in mine art
And left me to a bootless inquisition,

'Tis far off
How thou camest here thou mayst.
MIRANDA:
O the heavens!
O, my heart bleeds
Through all the signories it was the first
Sir, most heedfully.
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
With that which, but by being so retired,
Made such a sinner of his memory,
PROSPERO:
To most ignoble stooping.
I should sin
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Alack, for pity!

With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
MIRANDA:
An undergoing stomach, to bear up
Out of his charity, being then appointed
But ever see that man!
MIRANDA:
I find my zenith doth depend upon
All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
ARIEL:
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Not a soul
Why that's my spirit!
Not a hair perish'd;
Of the king's ship
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
ARIEL:
My liberty.
To bate me a full year.
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
ARIEL:
They would not take her life. Is not this true?
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts

PROSPERO:
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
Shake it off. Come on;
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
CALIBAN:
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
To name the bigger light, and how the less,

Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
Come unto these yellow sands,
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
Those are pearls that were his eyes:
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

I might call him
And that you will some good instruction give
My language! heavens!
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
And his brave son being twain.
FERDINAND:
One word more; I charge thee
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
He's gentle and not fearful.
MIRANDA:
PROSPERO:
My affections
So they are;
PROSPERO:
As mountain winds: but then exactly do
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,

When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,

Ay.

Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
You cram these words into mine ears against
Sir, he may live:


I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness

GONZALO:
And were the king on't, what would I do?
And use of service, none; contract, succession,
ANTONIO:
To feed my innocent people.
To excel the golden age.

ANTONIO:

We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
ANTONIO:
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
My strong imagination sees a crown
I do; and surely
Whiles thou art waking.
